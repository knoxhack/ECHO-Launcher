# ECHO Release Feed Policy

This policy is the canonical source of truth for every alpha release stream. A
release job must fail closed when source constants, builder publish targets, CI
inputs, or GitHub repository settings do not match this table exactly.

## Canonical feed map

| Track | Stream | GitHub owner | GitHub repo | Tag prefix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public | echo-launcher | knoxhack | ECHO-Launcher | launcher-v |
| public | echo-addons-studio | knoxhack | ECHO-Addons-Studio | v |
| public | echo-developers-studio | knoxhack | ECHO-Developer-Studio | v |
| public | echo-sdk | knoxhack | ECHO-SDK | sdk-v |
| public | echo-modules | knoxhack | ECHO-Modules | modules-v |
| public | ashfall-native-edition | knoxhack | ECHO-Ashfall-Native-Edition | ashfall-native-v |
| public | ashfall-neoforge-edition | knoxhack | ECHO-Ashfall-NeoForge-Edition | ashfall-neoforge-v |
| public | ashfall-standalone-edition | knoxhack | ECHO-Ashfall-Standalone-Edition | ashfall-standalone-v |
| index | echo-release-index | knoxhack | ECHO-Release-Index | index-v |

## Invariants

- Each release job has exactly one updater target repository.
- Public app updates ship from public `knoxhack` repositories.
- Public feeds must not contain internal artifacts, release metadata, updater manifests, or comments that point users to internal repositories.
- Internal feeds must not contain public artifacts, public updater manifests, or fallback links to public repositories.
- A release job must fail closed on any mismatch between this policy, source constants, package publish config, builder config, and workflow inputs.
- Stream variables are explicit per job and cannot be inferred from mutable user settings.
- Runtime update code must assert its selected owner/repo before contacting the updater feed.

## Required GitHub repository variables

Every release repository must define the variables that correspond to its track:

| Variable | Public repositories | Internal repositories |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RELEASE_FEED_OWNER | knoxhack | knoxhack |
| RELEASE_FEED_REPO | canonical repo for the job | canonical repo for the job |
| PUBLIC_FEED_OWNER | knoxhack | knoxhack |
| PUBLIC_FEED_REPO | public canonical repo, if the app has one | public canonical repo, if the app has one |
| INTERNAL_FEED_OWNER | unset unless dual-track | knoxhack |
| INTERNAL_FEED_REPO | unset unless dual-track | internal canonical repo |

The `scripts/validate-release-feed.mjs` preflight is mandatory for every release
job and must run before build, package, or publish steps.
